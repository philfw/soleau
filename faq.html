				<li>What is <span class="soleau">Soleau</span>?</li>
				<p>Soleau is an unofficial copyright registry that leverages the Internet to prove when you actually made a creative work. Soleau sends a work that you create, with a randomly generated 10-digit id, to your email and your Twitter account. It's like sending something to yourself in the mail to show that something happened on a particular date and at a particular time.</p>
				<li>Can I really get copyright protection from an email?</li>
				<p>Well, no. But you do actually get copyright protection in your original work as soon as it's "fixed." That means that it is recorded somewhere--e.g., on paper, in a text editor, or on film.</p>
				<li>But don't I actually have to register copyright with a government office to get "official" protection?</li>
				<p>No you do not! In most countries all you need to do is actually create the work, at which point you get full copyright protection on that work.</p>
				<li>So what's the point of this then?</li>
				<p>This is an anologue to the "Poor Man's Copyright," which is a way of proving when something comes into existence by sending it to yourself in the mail.</p>
